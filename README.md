# East-Coast-Power-Plant-Emissions-Sensitivity-Project
Daily power plant emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 from 26 Eastern United States were analyzed for their sensitivity to fluctuations in summertime ambient temperature.  Three separate June through August datasets of daily emissions, daily mean temperature, and total energy loads were included in the analysis.  

A reference case dataset consisted of outputs from the MyPower-RBEES model, with simulated 2007 energy loads from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (Skamarock and Klemp, 2008),and more current (circa 2010) building stock as inputs.  A mid-century warm climate dataset was obtained from the MyPower-RBEES model, run with 2010 building stock and daily average temperature obtained from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP, Mearns et al., 2012).  The third dataset consisted of historical daily emissions, energy loads, and recorded average ambient temperature collected over seven summers from 2007-2013.  Thus, the historical dataset was seven times larger than each of the simulated datasets.

In an attempt to present the historical data in a format congruent to the two simulated datasets, the 7 years of historical data was averaged by date for each state included in the analysis, resulting in 95 point datasets of equal dimensions to the model simulations.  However, the averaging method effectively hid the tail ends of the data distribution, producing only modest values.  The plotted results showed little variation in the x or y and did not sufficiently represent the data.  

The excel macro produced scatter plots of the three datasets with daily average temperature in Kelvin on the x-axis and SO2, NOx, or CO2 emissions in short tons on the y-axis.  Graphics were state and species specific, resulting in 78 total plots.  Each plot consisted of 10 series with corresponding regression lines; 7 historical years, 1 reference case, 1 mid-century warm climate case, and 1 averaged historical data series.
